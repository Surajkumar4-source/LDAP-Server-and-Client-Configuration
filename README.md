## **What is LDAP?**

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is an open, vendor-neutral, industry-standard application protocol used to access and manage directory information. It provides a central location for storing and retrieving structured data in a directory format, commonly used for storing user credentials, contact information, and other organizational data.

Unlike traditional databases, LDAP is optimized for read-heavy operations and fast lookups, making it ideal for directories where read access to information is far more common than write access.

---

## **Components of LDAP**

1. **LDAP Server (Directory Server)**:
   - **slapd** (Stand-alone LDAP Daemon) is the server component.
   - It stores and provides access to the directory data (users, groups, and more).
   - It listens for requests over TCP/IP on port **389 (LDAP)** or **636 (LDAPS)** for secure connections.
   - It uses **LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format)** to exchange information.

2. **LDAP Client**:
   - A client interacts with the LDAP server to search, query, and modify data stored in the directory.
   - **nsswitch.conf** (Name Service Switch) or **SSSD (System Security Services Daemon)** on clients can be configured to authenticate against an LDAP server.

3. **LDAP Directory**:
   - The directory is a structured collection of entries (such as users, groups, printers).
   - Entries are identified by a **Distinguished Name (DN)**, which uniquely identifies them in the directory hierarchy (e.g., `dn: cn=John Doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`).
   - The directory follows a hierarchical structure, typically in a tree form, with the root at the top and various organizational units (OUs) branching underneath.

---

## **LDAP Directory Structure**

LDAP uses a **tree-like structure** with the following components:

1. **DN (Distinguished Name)**:  
   - A unique identifier for an entry in the directory.
   - Example: `dn: cn=John Doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`

2. **DC (Domain Component)**:
   - Represents domain names in the LDAP hierarchy.
   - Example: `dc=example,dc=com`

3. **OU (Organizational Unit)**:
   - Logical grouping of entries.
   - Example: `ou=People`, `ou=Groups`

4. **CN (Common Name)**:
   - The name of an individual entry.
   - Example: `cn=John Doe`

---

## **LDAP Operations**

1. **Bind**:  
   - This operation authenticates the client to the LDAP server.
   - There are two types of binds:
     - **Simple Bind**: Uses a username/password combination.
     - **SASL Bind**: A more complex authentication method (e.g., Kerberos).

2. **Search**:  
   - This is the most common LDAP operation, used to query the directory for specific information.
   - You can search based on filters and retrieve specific attributes.

3. **Add**:  
   - This operation adds a new entry to the LDAP directory.

4. **Modify**:  
   - Used to modify existing directory entries (e.g., updating user details).

5. **Delete**:  
   - Removes an entry from the directory.

6. **Unbind**:  
   - Terminates the session between the client and the server.

---

## **LDAP Authentication**

LDAP is commonly used for centralized authentication, where multiple systems can authenticate users via a single LDAP server. In such cases:
- **Users** are stored in the LDAP directory and authenticated by comparing credentials (username/password) with stored values.
- **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)** and **SSSD** are typically used on Linux to connect systems to LDAP for user authentication.

When a user attempts to log in:
- The system checks the credentials (username/password) against the LDAP directory.
- If valid, the user is authenticated and granted access.

---

## **Why Use LDAP?**

1. **Centralized Authentication**:  
   LDAP allows organizations to manage user credentials (like passwords) in one central location, making it easier to manage access across multiple systems.

2. **Scalability**:  
   LDAP is designed for high-performance lookups. It can scale to handle large directories, making it suitable for enterprises.

3. **Cross-Platform**:  
   LDAP is supported across many platforms and services (e.g., Windows, Linux, applications), making it a versatile solution for managing user and group data.

4. **Secure Communication**:  
   LDAP supports secure communication via **LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS)**, ensuring data encryption during transmission.

5. **Standardized Protocol**:  
   LDAP is an open, standardized protocol, allowing interoperability between different systems and vendors.

---

## **LDAP vs Traditional Databases**

- **LDAP** is designed for high read operations and efficient searching of structured data.
- **Traditional databases** like MySQL or PostgreSQL are designed for transactional operations and relational data modeling.
- LDAP is **optimized for directory services**, whereas traditional databases are **optimized for handling large transactional loads**.

---

## **Common Use Cases for LDAP**

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:  
   - LDAP is often used in **SSO systems** where users can authenticate once and gain access to multiple services.

2. **Centralized User Management**:  
   - For managing user identities across various services (e.g., email, file servers, network devices).

3. **Access Control**:  
   - LDAP directories store group memberships and permissions, allowing organizations to control access to various resources.

4. **Address Books**:  
   - LDAP is commonly used for **email directory services** (e.g., for storing contact information in corporate address books).

5. **Authentication Backend**:  
   - Linux systems and network devices like routers, VPNs, and firewalls often use LDAP as the backend for user authentication.

---

### **LDAP Server Setup Overview**

1. **Install OpenLDAP server** and required tools.
2. **Configure the LDAP server** (set up root password, server certificate).
3. **Populate the directory** with organizational data (users, groups, etc.).
4. **Configure client machines** to authenticate using LDAP (set up SSSD or nsswitch.conf).
5. **Test authentication** by verifying LDAP queries and user logins.

---

### **Conclusion**

LDAP is a robust and highly efficient protocol for managing and accessing directory data. It is especially useful for centralized authentication, user management, and resource access control across various platforms and services. By setting up an LDAP server and integrating clients, organizations can streamline their IT infrastructure, reduce redundancy, and enhance security and control over user authentication.

### **Prerequisites for Setting Up LDAP Server and Client**

Before beginning the installation and configuration of LDAP on both the server and client, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

---

### **Prerequisites for LDAP Server**

1. **Operating System Requirements:**
   - **CentOS 7 or CentOS 9** is recommended for both the server and client.
   - Ensure the system is updated to the latest packages:
     ```bash
       yum update -y
     ```

2. **Network Configuration:**
   - The server should have a **static IP address**.
   - Ensure **DNS resolution** is properly set up for both the server and client:
     - LDAP server should be accessible by its **hostname** (e.g., `master.spider.com`) from the client machine.
     - The server's hostname must be resolvable via DNS or `/etc/hosts`.

3. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the necessary ports are open on the LDAP server machine:
     - **LDAP (389/tcp)**
     - **LDAPS (636/tcp)**, if using SSL/TLS
   - Configure firewall as needed (on both server and client):
     ```bash
       firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ldap --permanent
       firewall-cmd --reload
     ```

4. **SELinux Configuration:**
   - **Disable SELinux** temporarily or configure it to allow LDAP traffic:
     ```bash
       setenforce 0   # Disable SELinux temporarily (useful during setup)
     ```
   - Alternatively, adjust SELinux policies to allow LDAP services to run without disabling SELinux entirely.

5. **Dependencies & Tools:**
   - Make sure the system has the necessary tools to configure and manage OpenLDAP:
     ```bash
       yum install -y openldap openldap-servers openldap-clients openldap-devel migrationtools
     ```

6. **System Resources:**
   - Adequate disk space and memory for the LDAP server, as it will store all your directory data.
   - Ensure sufficient permissions to perform administrative tasks like modifying the LDAP configuration files.

7. **Backup:**
   - Backup your `/etc/hosts` and network configurations before starting the LDAP setup.
   - Backup `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` if migrating users to LDAP.

8. **Generate SSL Certificates (Optional but recommended for secure communication):**
   - OpenLDAP supports **TLS/SSL** for encrypting connections, and it is advisable to generate SSL certificates for secure LDAP communication.

---

### **Prerequisites for LDAP Client**

1. **Operating System Requirements:**
   - Ensure the client machine is running **CentOS 7** or **CentOS 9**.
   - Ensure the system is updated to the latest packages:
     ```bash
     # yum update -y
     ```

2. **Network Configuration:**
   - The client machine must be able to connect to the **LDAP server** by hostname or IP address.
   - **DNS resolution** must be correctly configured (both forward and reverse DNS lookups for the LDAP server).
   - Ensure the serverâ€™s **LDAP ports (389 and 636)** are open to the client machine.

3. **LDAP Client Tools Installation:**
   - Install the necessary LDAP client tools and utilities:
     ```bash
     # yum install openldap-clients nss-pam-ldapd -y  # For CentOS 7
     # yum install openldap-clients sssd sssd-ldap oddjob-mkhomedir -y  # For CentOS 9
     ```

4. **NSS & PAM Configuration:**
   - If using **SSSD** for authentication, ensure the appropriate **SSSD** configuration is made for integrating with LDAP.
   - For **autofs**, ensure the correct configuration is set to map home directories for LDAP users.

5. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Both the LDAP server and client must have **synchronized system time** (preferably via **NTP** or **Chrony**).
   - Incorrect time synchronization can lead to issues with certificate validity and authentication.

6. **User Authentication:**
   - Ensure that users on the LDAP client machine are correctly configured for **LDAP-based authentication** and that the client can retrieve users/groups from the server.
   - Ensure that you have valid **admin credentials** (e.g., `cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com`) for adding and querying LDAP users.

7. **Access to LDAP Schema:**
   - For **CentOS 7/9**, ensure that the client can access the **LDAP serverâ€™s schema** and that the required **schemas** (e.g., `cosine.ldif`, `nis.ldif`, `inetorgperson.ldif`) are loaded on the server.

8. **Home Directory Creation:**
   - If you want **home directories** for LDAP users to be automatically created upon login, ensure that the **oddjob-mkhomedir** service is installed and configured.
     ```bash
     # yum install oddjob-mkhomedir
     ```

9. **SSL Certificates (for secure communication):**
   - For secure communication between the client and server, configure **TLS** using the certificates generated on the server.
   - Place the server's **CA certificate** (or self-signed certificate) in the client machine's `/etc/openldap/certs/` directory.

---

### **General Prerequisites for Both Server and Client**

1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Ensure both the LDAP server and client have synchronized system clocks (preferably using **NTP** or **Chrony**).

2. **DNS and Network Resolution:**
   - Both the server and client machines must be able to resolve each other's hostnames.
   - Update `/etc/hosts` as needed if DNS is not available.

3. **Ensure OpenLDAP Service is Running:**
   - Check that the OpenLDAP (`slapd`) service is running on the server:
     ```bash
     # systemctl status slapd
     ```

4. **Root Access:**
   - Ensure you have **root access** on both the LDAP server and client for configuration and management.

5. **Backup and Restore Procedures:**
   - Set up proper **backup and restore** mechanisms for your LDAP data to avoid data loss in case of failures.

   ```

#### **6. Configure LDAP Server**
   Navigate to the LDAP configuration directory:
   ```yml
     cd /etc/openldap/slapd.d/
     cd cn=config
     ls -l
   ```

   Modify the main database configuration (`hdb.ldif`) to set the correct suffix and root DN:
   ```yml
     vim hdb_conf.ldif
   dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcSuffix
   olcSuffix: dc=spider,dc=com

   dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcRootDN
   olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com

   dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcRootPW
   olcRootPW: {SSHA}yPTjpRb8mwP1AMIy5LB2d+UzOu/MoTWc
   ```

   Apply the changes:
   ```yml
     ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f hdb_conf.ldif
   ```

#### **7. Configure LDAP Access Control**
   Modify the `monitor.ldif` file for LDAP access control:
   ```yml
     vim monitor_conf.ldif
   dn: olcDatabase={1}monitor,cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcAccess
   olcAccess: {0}to * by dn.base="gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth" read by dn.base="cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com" read by * none
   ```

   Apply the changes:
   ```yml
     ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f monitor_conf.ldif
   ```

#### **8. Configure SSL Certificates**
   Modify the LDAP configuration to use SSL certificates:
   ```yml
     vim cert.ldif
   dn: cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcTLSCertificateFile
   olcTLSCertificateFile: /etc/openldap/certs/ditiss.pem

   dn: cn=config
   changetype: modify
   replace: olcTLSCertificateKeyFile
   olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: /etc/openldap/certs/ditiss_key.pem
   ```

   Apply the changes:
   ```yml
     ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f cert.ldif
   ```

#### **9. Configure Base LDAP Entries**
   Create a base LDIF file with domain, manager, and organizational units:
   ```yml
     vim base.ldif
   dn: dc=spider,dc=com
   dc: spider
   objectClass: top
   objectClass: domain

   dn: cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com
   objectClass: organizationalRole
   cn: ldapadm
   description: LDAP Manager

   dn: ou=People,dc=spider,dc=com
   objectClass: organizationalUnit
   ou: People

   dn: ou=Group,dc=spider,dc=com
   objectClass: organizationalUnit
   ou: Group
   ```

   Add the entries to the LDAP database:
   ```yml
     ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com" -y /tmp/pass -f base.ldif
   ```

#### **10. Test Configuration**
   Test the LDAP configuration:
   ```yml
     slaptest -u
   ```

#### **11. Migrate User Data**
   Use the `migrationtools` package to migrate users and groups from `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` to LDAP:

   - Copy the user/group data:
     ```yml
       egrep ":[0-9]{4,}:" /etc/passwd > /usr/share/migrationtools/passwd
       egrep ":[0-9]{4,}:" /etc/group > /usr/share/migrationtools/group
     ```

   - Configure migration:
     ```yml
       vim /usr/share/migrationtools/migrate_common.ph
     $DEFAULT_MAIL_DOMAIN = "spider.com"
     $DEFAULT_BASE = "dc=spider,dc=com"
     ```

   - Run migration scripts:
     ```yml
       ./migrate_passwd.pl /usr/share/migrationtools/passwd /usr/share/migrationtools/users.ldif
       ./migrate_passwd.pl /usr/share/migrationtools/group /usr/share/migrationtools/groups.ldif
     ```

   - Add migrated users and groups to LDAP:
     ```yml
       ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com" -y /tmp/pass -f /usr/share/migrationtools/users.ldif
       ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=Manager,dc=spider,dc=com" -y /tmp/pass -f /usr/share/migrationtools/groups.ldif
     ```

#### **12. Configure Firewall**
   Allow LDAP traffic through the firewall:
   ```yml
     firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ldap --permanent
     firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

---

### LDAP Client Configuration

#### **1. Install OpenLDAP Client Tools**
   Install the necessary packages on the LDAP client:
   ```yml
     yum install openldap-clients nss-pam-ldapd -y
   ```

   Alternatively, for CentOS 9:
   ```yml
     yum install openldap-clients sssd sssd-ldap oddjob-mkhomedir -y
   ```

#### **2. Configure LDAP Authentication**
   For CentOS 7, configure LDAP authentication:
   ```yml
     authconfig --enableldap --enableldapauth --ldapserver=ldap://master.spider.com --ldapbasedn="dc=spider,dc=com" --enablemkhomedir --update
   ```

   For CentOS 9, select the `sssd` profile:
   ```yml
     authselect select sssd with-mkhomedir --force
   ```

#### **3. Configure SSSD for LDAP**
   Edit the SSSD configuration file (`/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`):
   ```yml
     vim /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
   [domain/default]
   id_provider = ldap
   autofs_provider = ldap
   auth_provider = ldap
   chpass_provider = ldap
   ldap_uri = ldap://master.spider.com/
   ldap_search_base = dc=spider,dc=com
   ldap_tls_cacertdir = /etc/openldap/certs
   cache_credentials = True
   ldap_tls_reqcert = allow

   [sssd]
   services = nss, pam, autofs
   domains = default



   [nss]
   homedir_substring = /home
   ```

   Set permissions on the config file:
   ```yml
     chmod 600 /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
   ```

   Restart the required services:
   ```yml
     systemctl restart sssd oddjobd
     systemctl enable sssd oddjobd
   ```

#### **4. Test LDAP Authentication**
   Test that LDAP users can authenticate:
   ```yml
     getent passwd ldapuser1
     getent passwd ldapuser2
   ```

   Switch to the LDAP user:
   ```yml
     su - ldapuser1
     su - ldapuser2
   ```

This completes the setup of both the LDAP server and the LDAP client!
